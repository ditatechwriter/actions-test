# Genus

A low-level taxonomic rank used in the classification of living and fossil organisms. Other well-known taxonomic ranks are domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, and species, with genus fitting between family and species. The scientific name of a genus may be called the generic name: it is always capitalized.
