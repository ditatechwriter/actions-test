# Cultivar

A cultivar is a cultivated plant that has been selected and given a unique name because of its decorative or useful characteristics; it is usually distinct from similar plants and when propagated it retains those characteristics. The word cultivar is generally regarded as a portmanteau of "**culti**vated" and "**var**iety", but could also be derived from "**culti**gen" "**var**iety".
